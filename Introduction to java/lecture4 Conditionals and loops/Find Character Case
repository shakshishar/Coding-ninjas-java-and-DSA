Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.


1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.


Example:
Input: Character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.
Input format :
The only line contains a single character.


Output format :
The only line contains 1, 0, or -1 according to the above rules.


Constraints :
The input can be any character.
Sample Input 1 :
v



import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = s.next();
        char ch = str.charAt(0);
        if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z')
         {
            System.out.println("1");
        } 
        else if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z')
         {
            System.out.println("0");
        } 
        else
         {
            System.out.println("-1");
        }

    }
}
